# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I'm ~~a dragon lost in human world~~ now a MRes (Master of Research student) at the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/). Before that, I got my bachelor's degree in [Applied Mathematics](https://math.xmu.edu.cn/) at [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/) in 2017. I'm now at my graduate study and will be a PhD student from September 2021.

I'm trying to find a balance between research and coding.

Research-wise, I'm currently mainly working on topics related to Macro Economics including machine learning analysis.

I used to work on deep learning, involving natural language processing (machine translation and language generation), image captioning, time series analysis and dynamic programming.

I'm also learning to build webpage. I'm also learning CSS, HTML and React.
